# Spartacus Documentation

All Spartacus documentation is published in the [Spartacus Wiki](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/wiki).

The documentation in the `current_drafts` directory is for features that are still in development, and for draft documentation that has not yet been reviewed by a writer. When the review process is complete, documentation is removed from this directory and published in the Spartacus Wiki.

The installation instructions provided in the `archived_installation_docs` directory allow you to set up a Spartacus-based project with an older version of SAP Commerce Cloud. However, some features and bug fixes require the latest version of SAP Commerce Cloud. It is always recommended to run your Spartacus-based storefront with the latest version of SAP Commerce Cloud.
