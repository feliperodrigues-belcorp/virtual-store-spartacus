# Documentation Drafts

All Spartacus documentation is published in the [Spartacus Wiki](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront/wiki).

The documentation in this directory is for features that are still in development, and for draft documentation that has not yet been reviewed by a writer. When the review process is complete, documentation is removed from this directory and published in the Spartacus Wiki.
